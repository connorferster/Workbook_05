    "A `dict` is a dictionary. Just like a printed dictionary where you look up words to find their meanings, you can use a `dict` to look up keys to find their values. These key/value pairs are stored in the dictionary like a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You create a dictionary by using _braces_ `{...}`. You separate the keys and values with a _colon_, `:`. You separate key/value pairs with a _comma_ `,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = {\"concrete\": \"35 MPa\", \"steel\": \"400 MPa\", \"wood\": \"19.2 MPa\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use indexing notation to get the value you want. With a list, you use the position of the list item as the index. With a dictionary, you use the key of the item you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a key is _not_ in the `dict`, you get an `IndexError`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict[\"concrete\"] # Returns \"35 MPa\"\n",
    "my_dict[\"steel\"] # Returns \"400 MPa\"\n",

    "### `dict` methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `dict` is a built-in type (like `list` and `str`), it also has some built-in methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some of the most commonly used methods:\n",
    "* `.update(new_dict_values: dict)` - Use .update to add new key/values to the dict or to change the value of an existing key. \n",
    "* `.get(key, [default = None])` - Use .get to get the value associated with the key. If the key is not found then return the \"default\" value.\n",
    "* `.keys()` - Use .keys in a for loop to iterate over the keys of the dictionary\n",
    "* `.values()` - Use .values in a for loop to iterate over the values of the dictionary\n",
    "* `.items()` - Use .items in a for loop to iterate over each key, value pair (i.e. loops over both keys/values at the same time)\n",

This means, after our function runs, we need to have access to the reaction symbol that was created _within_ the function. Remember, using `return` is the way that we can transfer data from inside the function scope to outside the function scope. By returning the symbol created within the function along with the `Beam`, we can add the symbol to an accumulator in our \"master loop\".\n",

You write functions that perform all of the individual small tasks you need to do. From there, you combine them to perform the larger tasks. Eventually, you may end up with a program that just calls one or two functions to do all of the work by calling all of your smaller functions. \n",
